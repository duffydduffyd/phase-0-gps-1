### **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Prior to the GPS sessions I was struggling with pull requests, along with the process of fetching and merging. 
### **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?** 
We managed to clarify pull requests and their functionality (pull requests are like requesting an editor to overlook a document before publishing). We also clarified the use of add (to stage changes), reviewed markdown, and clarified the fetching and merging process. 
### **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
We asked the guide for help clarifying with the commit process, and about functionalities in Github that you can use for the pull request process. I asked my pair for help on fetching and merging, and also to double check my git commands as I was driving since they aren't quite second nature yet. 
### **What still confuses you about Git?**
Right now, I *hope* that I've gotten to the bottom of everything that we've learned thus far, though I suppose the only way to know is to keep using git and see when I get stuck.
### **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I thought it was super enjoyable! It's a great way to figure out what concepts you haven't quite mastered, and I really like the combination of teaching and learning with a pair.
